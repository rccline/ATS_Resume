ATS_Resume is my Resume in a friendly ATS format. 

**ATS = Applicant Tracking System**
These are software programs that companies use to manage job applications. When you submit a resume online, it typically goes into an ATS before a human ever sees it.
Popular ATS programs:

**Workday** — common in large enterprises
**Greenhouse** — popular with tech companies and startups
**Lever** — another tech-focused option
**Taleo** (Oracle) — used by many Fortune 500 companies
**iCIMS** — widely used across industries
**BambooHR** — common in small to mid-size companies

<u>How it works</u>:

You submit your resume through a company's job portal
The ATS parses (reads) your resume and extracts information — name, contact info, work history, skills, education
It scores or ranks candidates based on keyword matches to the job description
Recruiters search and filter candidates within the system
Only resumes that pass this initial screening get human review

**ATS-friendly formatting means**:

Simple, clean layouts (no tables, columns, graphics, or fancy fonts)
Standard section headings (Experience, Education, Skills)
Keywords from the job description included naturally
Plain text or simple .docx/.pdf formats
No headers/footers (some systems can't read them)

The ATS_Resume project likely strips away visual design in favor of parseable structure.
